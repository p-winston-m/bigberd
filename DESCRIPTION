Description: Package bigBERD generates .Rmd files containing prewritten R code chunks
    to visualize data in a provided dataset, to perform univariate testing, generate tables, perform simple regression and multiple regression. The above is controlled via a generated info_*.csv file which contains a number of instructions for the package and is able to be modified by the user. The package also contains code to generate a directory tree to facilitate good data practices. Nearly all of the generated code relies on the suggested packages. However, only a certain subset of packages are required for any given .Rmd document. Hence the suggested status.
